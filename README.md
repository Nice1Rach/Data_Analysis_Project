# Data_Analysis_Project
I analyze salary data across countries, focusing on income distribution from the lowest to the highest earners. Using visual tools like bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots, we depict salary disparities both within and across nations. This insight helps stakeholders understand global salary benchmarks and highlights areas of income inequality.


Salary Data Analysis
This project involves an exploratory data analysis of salaries across different countries. We utilize various visualization techniques to understand the distribution and disparity of incomes.
